## Overview and Origin
Netflix is an American company that specializes as a streaming service for users.  Netflix was founded in August 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph.  It initially started as a home-video mail rental service, wherein a user/subscriber could order a DVD of the movie or show that they wanted to watch and expect the physical DVD to be mailed to their address.  The idea for the company originated when both co-founders were carpooling to their somes in Santa Cruz, California.  However, a commonly told story is one where Hastings did not appreciate a $40 fee from Blockbuster when being late to return the movie Apollo 13.  Intial funding of the company was a combination of Hastings' own investment in his company and user subscriptions.  Today, Netflix's main source of revenue comes from user subscriptions which amounted to a Q4 2023 income of a little over 260 million dollars.  

## Business Activities
Currently, Netflix faces stiff competition from other streaming services/companies.  With so many different streaming options, Netflix faces a unique problem: how can they continue to innovate and pioneer the streaming landscape while delivering quality entertainment to their users?  According to their [latest quarterly earnings shareholder report](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/NEW-FINAL-Q4-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf): 
>*"[Netflix's] north star remains the same: to thrill members with our entertainment."*  

There does not seem to be a speific intended customer for Netflix, thus furthering their broad and ambitious goals of reaching as many people as they can with their quality entertainment and a solid technological solution.  

Many credit Netflix with being the first major streaming service, mainly due to its use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to recommend movies and shows to users.  Having had significantly more time to develop, train, and implement this technology in its platform, Netflix maintains more global presence than other streaming services.  Within its platform, Netflix uses machine learning for a wide array of challenges: recommendation engine, search engine, A/B testing, as well as using it to drive its media understanding.  One such example of using its machine learning platform to drive competitive advantage is the use of personalized artwork for each title.  [According to its own tech blog](https://netflixtechblog.com/discovering-creative-insights-in-promotional-artwork-295e4d788db5), by understanding their user base via clustering algorithms, Netflix can determine which images would be the **best ones to show a user**, which would lead the user to stream said content.  Pretty wild.

## Landscape
Netflix is designated as a OTT streaming serivice in the field of technology, specifically streaming.  Video streaming is a field that has gone through various innovations in the past couple of years.  A couple of them are:
 - Machine learning recommendation systems
 - Artificial intelligence generated content/artwork
 - Data-driven business decisions for investment
 - AI-optimized marketing strategies

 These advancements in the field have allowed other companies to enter into the playing field of streaming.  Companies such as:
  - Apple - *Apple TV+*
  - Disney - *Hulu* and *Disney+*
  - Amazon - *Prime Video*
  - Warner Bros. - *Max* (formerly HBO Max)

## Results
The business impact of this company so far has been monumental.  Netflix remains a top player in the global "streaming wars" and continues to provide quality and highly-streamed content such as: *Squid Game*, *The Crown*, and *Selling Sunset* respectively.  In 2023, Netflix's revenue reached 8.83 billion dollars with a 12.3% YOY increase.  Some core metrics most streaming companies use to measure success are subscriber growth, ad revenue (if applicable), minutes of original content streamed, to name a few.  Netflix continues to be a top player in all the aforementioned metrics.  

## Recommendations
Netflix continues to innovate and perform at the highest level it can.  However, global outreach strategy is one that requires a significant investment by Netflix - it has to acquire rights to local shows that could drive people to its platform.  One recommendation for Netflix would be to continue to invest in key markets such as LATAM and Southern Asia.  With the current offering of technological advancements in the platform along with the quality content that it can deliver, Netflix has a huge opportunity to capitalize on emerging creative markets.  Market basket analyses and machine learning optimization of content creation will allow Netflix to specialize their delivery of quality content to key markets.
